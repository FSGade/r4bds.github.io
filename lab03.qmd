```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
library("tidyverse")
library("ggridges")
```


_Read the steps of this exercises carefully, while completing them_ 

### Introduction

Some authors are kind enough to supply the data they used for their paper, e.g.:

- [_"Assessment of the influence of intrinsic environmental and geographical factors on the bacterial ecology of pit latrines"_](https://sfamjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1751-7915.12334)

Where the supporting data can be found here:

- [http://userweb.eng.gla.ac.uk/umer.ijaz/bioinformatics/ecological.html](http://userweb.eng.gla.ac.uk/umer.ijaz/bioinformatics/ecological.html)

### Getting Started

Again, go to the [R for Bio Data Science RStudio Cloud Server](https://teaching.healthtech.dtu.dk/22100/rstudio.php) session from last time and login and choose the project you created

- **Create a new Quarto Document for todays exercises, e.g. lab03_exercises.qmd**
- **NB! The rmarkdown document MUST be placed together with your `.Rproj` file (defining, the project root - look in your `Files`-tab) and also there, the `data`-folder should be placed!**
- **REMEMBER paths are important! Also, R is case-sensitive, i.e. "data" is not the same as "Data"**

### Getting the data

Add a new code chunk and add the following code (Never mind the details, we will get back to this), remember you can use headers to nicely section your quarto Document.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
base_url <- "http://userweb.eng.gla.ac.uk/umer.ijaz/bioinformatics/ecological/"

SPE <- read_csv(file = str_c(base_url, "SPE_pitlatrine.csv"))
write_csv(x = SPE, file = "data/SPE_pitlatrine.csv")

ENV <- read_csv(file = str_c(base_url, "ENV_pitlatrine.csv"))
write_csv(x = ENV, file = "data/ENV_pitlatrine.csv")
```

Add the chunk settings `#| echo: true` and `#| eval: true`, then run the block and change the latter to `#| eval: false`.

- Discuss in your group, what this means and why we do it

<details>
<p><summary>Click here for hint</summary></p>
From where do we retrieve the data and to where do we write it and what happens if we run the chunk more than one time?
</details>

### Wrangling the data

- What is data wrangling?

Before we continue with plotting, we want to unify the data, so here again you will run some code, where the details are not important right now.

But... Make sure, that you have run `library("tidyverse")` somewhere in your rmarkdown document - Perhaps under an initial header saying "Load Libraries" or similar?

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
SPE |> 
  pivot_longer(cols = -Taxa,
               names_to = "Samples",
               values_to = "OTU_Count")  |> 
  full_join(ENV, by = "Samples") |> 
  mutate(site = case_when(str_detect(Samples, "^T") ~ "Tanzania",
                          str_detect(Samples, "^V") ~ "Vietnam")) |>  
  write_tsv(file = "data/SPE_ENV.tsv")
```

Change the chunk settings as before

## Data Visualisation II

### Read the data
```{r}
#| message: false
SPE_ENV <- read_tsv(file = "data/SPE_ENV.tsv")
SPE_ENV
```

### IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS - READ!

_For these exercises, you will have to identify what you see in the plot!_

For each plot, complete the following steps

1. Look at this overview of the components of a ggplot (see below)
1. Look at the plot you are to recreate and discuss in the group:
   1. What is the data? Take a look at it and understand what is _in_ the data
   1. What are the mappings? I.e. what variables are on the x-/y-axis?
   1. Are there any colour-/fill-mappings?
   1. What are the geoms used?
   1. Are there any modifications to theme?

_Hints_

- Consult the [Data visualization with ggplot2 cheatsheet](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/data-visualization.pdf)
- Check which options you have available
- Consult the chapters in the book you read, see preparation materials for labs 2 and 3

### TASKS

#### Task 1 - Recreate the following plot

_Discuss in your group, which ggplot elements can you identify?_

```{r}
#| echo: false
ggplot(data = SPE_ENV,
       mapping = aes(x = OTU_Count,
                     y = Taxa,
                     fill = site)) +
  geom_boxplot()

  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")

<details>
<p><summary>Click here for hint</summary></p>
_See if you can find something online on `geom_smooth()`_ 
</details>

_Discuss in your group, which ggplot elements can you identify?_

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false

ggplot(data = SPE_ENV,
       mapping = aes(x = Taxa,
                     y = Samples,
                     fill = OTU_Count)) +
  geom_tile(alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_fill_gradient2(midpoint = 10000,
                       low = "blue",
                       mid = "white",
                       high = "red") +
  theme_classic(base_size = 8) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

<details>
<p><summary>Click here for hint</summary></p>
_Think about `fill` and then see if you can find something online on `geom_tile()`, `scale_fill_gradient2` and how to `ggplot rotate axis labels`_ 
</details>

#### Task 8 - Recreate the following plot

Start by running this code in a new chunk (ignore details for now)

```{r}
targets <- c("Methanobacteria", "Clostridia", "Actinobacteria",
            "Sphingobacteria", "Anaerolineae")
SPE_ENV_targets <- SPE_ENV |>
  filter(Taxa %in% targets)
```

and then use the created dataset `SPE_ENV_targets` to recreate this plot:

_Discuss in your group, which ggplot elements can you identify?_

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
ggplot(data = SPE_ENV_targets,
       mapping = aes(x = OTU_Count,
                     y = Taxa,
                     fill = Taxa)) +
  geom_density_ridges(alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d() +
  labs(x = "OTU Count",
       y = "Taxa Identified",
       title = "OTU Count Distribution for 5 Taxa Stratified on Site",
       caption = "Data from doi.org/10.1111/1751-7915.12334") +
  theme_minimal(base_family = "Avenir",
                base_size = 12) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  facet_wrap(facets = vars(site),
             ncol = 2)
```

<details>
<p><summary>Click here for hint</summary></p>
_Here we need to use `geom_density_ridges()`, but which package contains this? Also we are using a colour scale called `viridis`, but how do we add this? Also, perhaps there are more themes we can use than just `theme_classic()?`_ 
</details>

#### Task 9 - <span style="color: red;">GROUP ASSIGNMENT</span>

_For this assignment you and your group are to apply what you have learned in the two data visualisation labs. The task is to create a really nice plot using one of two datasets, the `cancer_data` or the `SPE_ENV`_

##### Instructions

- This time, submit one __PDF__ file per group
- Submit only _this_ assignment, _not_ the entire exercises
- Make it nice, add a title, your group number and names and a bit of text to along with your data visualisation
- Deadline is Thursday 23:59 as usual
