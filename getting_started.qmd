## Logging onto Cloud Server

First, make sure you have a working DTU account, either as a student id or employee initials (e.g. PhD-students or postdocs). In this course we will be using a cloud server infrastructure to perform our work. Click below to access the cloud server:

- [R for Bio Data Science Cloud Server](https://teaching.healthtech.dtu.dk/22100/rstudio.php)

_Note, that there is a 24h time out on the sessions, meaning that if you logon and forget to sign out, your session will be terminated after 24h._

## Setting up a GitHub account

Prior to class, please go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and setup and account, shouldn't take long. During the registration process you can set up a student account, which will give you additional benefits, including GitHub Pro. In order to get it, you need to use your DTU email when setting account and select Apply for your GitHub student benefits when asked during the registration process. You'll be then asked to apply for GitHub Student Developer Pack, which will require uploading your student id photo. The process of confirming a student account may take up to a few days (however, it can be almost instantaneous). In the meantime you can already use your free account. Free account should be sufficient for this class, so if you don't want to set up a school account, you don't need to. Please state your GitHub username in [this google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yXC3ZBr4nS3DIJuBXFxejqsybI-kGU_NFrVupye6B6E/edit?usp=sharing).

## Class Communication

To streamline class communication, we will be using Slack. The aim is to facilitate getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates, the TAs, and myself. Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff, I encourage you to post your questions on Slack. Each teaching lab will have its own dedicated Slack channel.

## Group Formation

The backbone of this course is modern **collaborative** data science and as such group work and active participation herein is mandatory. Furthermore, It is **important** that course participants prioritise to **be present** during classes as the course design is based on student-student interaction in an active learning environment.

Therefore, students will work in groups of 4-5 students. Group formation sheet can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P3wbjztVje5s5REtUhldcIr9gTtEMkDLJo6YMBfPOis/edit?usp=sharing)
