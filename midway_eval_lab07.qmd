## Midway Evaluation

- Our opportunity to understand if the course elements works as intended
- Your opportunity to let us know, how the course looks on the students side
- Super important to align
- 76 out of 124 enrolled students answered this year 
- THANK YOU for this important contribution!

## Highlights: What's Working Well in the Course

- The course is well-organized, with clear structure, helpful recaps of previous material, and balanced lecture-to-exercise time

- Hands-on approach with well-guided exercises that align with learning level

- The TAs play a crucial role by offering timely assistance, encouraging questions

- Working in teams is beneficial for learning, especially when combined with the practical nature of the assignments

- Course materials, particularly the website, reading materials, and exercises, are helpful in getting through the course content

## Highlights: What could be better

- Workload of exercises is sometimes too large, unevenly spread across weeks, or time-consuming, particularly Week 5
- Several students experienced difficulties with the R cloud server and prefer working locally with RStudio
- Many students would prefer slightly longer lectures with more in-depth explanations rather than relying heavily on pre-class preparation
- The volume of reading and preparation materials, with some finding it difficult to manage before each class
- The early start times pose challenges for some students, particularly those commuting, making it harder to follow the course

## Highlights: Group Assignment Element

- Group work can be challenging due to varying skill levels, often leading to one or two group members completing most of the work
- Differences in progress during in-class exercises and limited time for coordination outside class make group collaboration difficult for some students.
- Many find the group assignments beneficial for practice, some feel the tasks are too large or complex to be effectively tackled as a group within the available time
- Generally the feedback is found useful and constructive, helping to improve their work throughout the course
- Several students suggest smaller groups for more effective collaboration and equal participation in the assignments

## Highlights: Open input and feedback

- Many students prefer working with RStudio locally rather than using the R cloud server, which some found unreliable
- Collaborating on group assignments is difficult due to varying skill levels and working paces, which impacts the ability to collaborate effectively
- Students appreciate the overall structure, but there is some feedback suggesting more balance in the amount of preparation material and fewer exercises in certain weeks (e.g., Week 5)
- Students find the feedback valuable, but some mentioned issues with only the person submitting the group assignment being able to view it, suggesting improvements for accessibility across the group
- Overall, students find the course highly valuable, particularly in terms of learning R and bio data science, with several suggesting it should be promoted more to bachelor students and integrated into earlier stages of their studies
