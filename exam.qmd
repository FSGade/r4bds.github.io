# Exam {.unnumbered}

## Design

The exam consists of 3 components:

1. A group project, where all members are responsible for all parts of the project. This is handed in as a code base on the course GitHub repository
1. An oral group presentation of the project, where all group members, as per DTU rules on oral exams, must be physically present
1. A two hour multiple choice quiz (MCQ) exam, where general course learning objectives are examined, see course description

*Please note that active participation in the group work and timely submission of project and code base are both indispensable prerequisites for exam participation. The final grade is based on an overall assessment of all three components.*

## Deadlines and Dates

1. Project code base and presentation must be completed at the latest 23:59 on the day before lab 13. Note, you **cannot** edit anything on the GitHub repository after this deadline!
1. The oral presentation will be on lab 13 of the course, see DTU Learn calender for dates
1. The MCQ is placed according to the DTU exam schedule
