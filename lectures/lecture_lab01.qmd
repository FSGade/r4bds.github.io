## About

### Course Description
- Basically, what can you expect to learn and what do I expect that you learn: [https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/22100](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/22100)

### Course Resources

- Text Book: ["R for Data Science"](https://r4ds.had.co.nz) by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham
- See course frontpage on DTU Learn for additional learning resources

### Course format

- Active Learning: _Strong emphasis on students working in groups_, rather than me talking
- The focus is on you working actively, _not_ me talking
- I will _not_ go through all preparation materials in class
- Proper preparation is a prerequisite for completing lab exercises and maximising course yield
- I focus on supporting your independence, hence for some exercises you will have to seek out information (_I'm not a good data scientist, I'm just slightly better at googling than others_)

## Exercise feedback

### Weekly
- An exercise question will be highlighted 
- Each group is responsible for crafting an answer to this highlighted question
- These answers will be hand-ins
- The following week, we will choose a random answer to be discussed in plenum

## Group Formation

- Modern Bio Data Science is a team sport!
- You have to form a group of 4 students (3-5) with a Shared Bio Data Science / Bioinformatics Area of Interest
- You will work in these groups throughout the course
- You will do the final project in these groups
- You will attend the exam in these groups
- Group work is a _very important_ meta skill for an engineer!
- Please fill in groups, see schedule for lab 1
- If you do not have a group, fill in your id and interest at an available group and someone might join you
- I aim to let you decide on the groups, I will of course be happy to help if needed
