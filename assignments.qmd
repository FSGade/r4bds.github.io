# Assignments {.unnumbered}

*As part of this course, starting from Lab 2, there will be a weekly hand in. Here, follows the instructions for creating and handing in course assignments.*

## Assignment Instructions

The assignment will be marked "Group Assignment" with red font in the exercises. In your group, you are to prepare an answer to **just this one question**. Think about reproducibility from the get-go, so include in your assignment, what is needed to re-create your micro-report, e.g. if you're using external data, from where and how did you get it? You will then receive group feedback on your assignment, which you should make sure to go over in your group.

*Please note, that in order to include all elements in a self-contained html file, you will have to use the following YAML-header in your Quarto document:*

````
---
title: "Lab 2 Assignment: Group 02"
format:
  html:
    embed-resources: true
editor: visual
---
````

*Or at least one similar, format title and other elements as you see fit, key here is the `html`-format with embedded resources.*
