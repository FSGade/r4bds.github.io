    1. If you have Linux, you'll know what to do
    1. For mac, be aware that you have to choose either `R-4.3.2-arm64.pkg` or `R-4.3.2-x86_64.pkg` (versions as of 30-11-23) depending on whether you have a `M`- or an `Intel`-mac. This you can find out by clicking the apple in the upper left corner of your screen and select `About This Mac` and look at what is says next to `Chip`

## Installing RStudio

1. Go to the [Posit](https://posit.co) site
1. Click `DOWNLOAD RSTUDIO` in the upper right corner
1. Under `RStudio Desktop`, click `DOWNLOAD RSTUDIO`
1. The first point `1: Install R` is covered above
1. Under `2: Install RStudio`, click the blue box below, it will vary depending on your OS, mine says `DOWNLOAD RSTUDIO DESKTOP FOR MACOS 11+`
1. Open the downloaded installer and follow the instructions

## Installing packages

Once you have downloaded and installed `R` and `RStudio`, you can start installing packages. E.g. we can install `Tidyverse` using the command:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

install.packages("tidyverse")
```

Look through the different exercise labs at the top, the packages you have been working with are stated.

## Open course materials

The downloaded course materials can simply be opened directly in `RStudio`, so be sure to organise them, so you can easily access them on your own computer.
