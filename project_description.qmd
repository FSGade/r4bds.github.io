# Project Description {.unnumbered}

## Project Groups

- You will be working in the groups assigned from the beginning of the course.

- IMPORTANT: _All groups members are responsible for all parts of the project!_

- Note, completing the project is considered your exam preparation

## Project as a Collaborative effort

As per the course description at the DTU course base: *Active participation in the group work and timely submission of project and code base are both indispensable prerequisites for exam participation.*

This means, that each group member is expected to:

 - Generally participate **actively** in the group project
 - Take responsibility for solving assigned tasks within the project
 - Write and review code and perform commit-/push-/pulls to the project GitHub repository
 - Meet and discuss **actively** with the group members
 - Spend 9-10h per week on the project for the full 3 week project period

_Bio Data Science is a collaborative effort, which is reflected in the design of the project module of this course!_

## Expected time usage

As per the rules for the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS) points, 1 credit equals 28 hours. Therefore, for a 5-person group working for 3 weeks, the expected total project hours is ~150. Setup your collaborative project and this will be more than sufficient to create a full bio data science project. Note, for lab 13, you workload will be a ~10min. presentation therefore the hours for this lab is included.

## Project Description

### Aim

The aim with the Project module of the course is to allow you to independently work with the course elements, you have been exposed to during the first 9 weeks of teaching. Here, you will synthesise the entire bio data science cycle, thereby internalising the course elements. Moreover, you are to:

- Use the tools you have learned in the course and _"design and execute a bio data science project focusing on collaborative coding and reproducibility, incl. independently using online resources to seek information about application and technical details of state-of-the-art data science tools"_

Recall the "Data Science Cycle"

## Project Requirements

### Organisation

Your project must strictly adhere to the organisation illustrated below:

![](images/viz_bio_data_science_project_organisation_qmd.png){fig-align="center" width=90%}

**Important: This entails, that the entire project as put on GitHub, can be cloned and then executed end-to-end**

### Code

Your project must strictly adhere to the [Course Code Styling Guide](code_styling.qmd)

### Data

*First and foremost, you must find a data set you can work with in the project!*

- It must be based on a bio data set

- Start out as "dirty" i.e. a completely clean and analysis-ready data set will not allow you to demonstrate, that you have met the course learning objectives

- It is advisable, that the data is limited size, so you do not risk time waste due to long runtimes

- Note, you should demonstrate ability to extract biological insights, but at the same time mind that the focus should be on demonstrating that you master the data science toolbox according to course aim and learning objectives

- Remember, **the process is the product!**

- *Naturally, you cannot reuse the data we have worked with during the exercise labs*

### Presentation
  
- A 10-slides-in-10-mins presentation, possibly followed by a few questions

- Follow the IMRAD standard scientific structure:
  - Introduction
  - Materials and Methods
  - Results (And)
  - Discussion
  
- With a technical focus, but minding to communicate which-ever biological insights you arrived at

- Should **not** include all your code, but rather focus on the broader picture and include data summaries and visualisations
  
- Created using [`Quarto Presentation`](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/), just as the course slides are

- NOTE: This final presentation in HTML-format should be uploaded to DTU Learn before deadline, so we can check the GitHub version is identical

## Project Supervision

- As a point of reference, this project is part of the overall assessment and you will therefore have limited access to supervision

- Think of the project, as a long take-home-assignment

- I **highly** encourage the use of Piazza for questions, which will be monitored by the teaching team

- Also, a rather comprehensive list of [frequently asked questions](project_faq.qmd) have been compiled, so be sure to check that out!

- I recommend using your course Quarto documents for reference 

- Also, perhaps you can get input on the [Posit Community Pages](https://community.rstudio.com)
