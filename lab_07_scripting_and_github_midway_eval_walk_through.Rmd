## Overall Course Satisfaction

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/course_midway_evaluation.png")
```

## Highlights: Name 3 things in the course, which works well?

- Collaborative focus
- Course structure (Both build-up and 1+3 format)
- Supplementing reading material with videos
- Mixing "Live" lecturing with videos
- Hands-on focus
- The textbook

## Highlights: Name 3 things in the course which could be better?

- Too much preparation material
- Too long exercises
- Answers/solutions to ALL exercises
- Record own videos
- DTU Learn
- More exhaustive lecturing
- Slides available as pdf prior to session

## Highlights: How can I facilitate student-to-student discussions on course content in a better way?

- Slack / Discord / Piazza / Teams
- Prefer within group discussions
- DTU Learn is non-intuitive
- Prefer anonymity enabling asking "stupid questions"

## General themes

### Time usage
- 5 ECTS point equates to 9-10h workload per week, i.e. 4h in class and 5-6h outside class

### "The teacher should teach us"
- I understand and I know you are used to this but research into teaching-and-learning clearly shows that active-learning results in a better learning-yield "Teaching is not talking on you"

### Slides in advance and exercise solutions
- Teaching is adapted dynamically, so slides are often changed last-minute, also I might skip slides, when I talk
- Spend time on being "mentally" present during teaching rather than studying slides (Slides were never an option, when we used chalk and overheads)
- Focus on process and problem solution over "answer-hunting", you are _always_ welcome to contact me (No answers in the real world)

## Also

- #### Many kind words about the course and my teaching - Thank you!

- #### If you feel your voice has not been heard in these highlights, please get in contact with me

- #### Lastly: I _really_ want you to learn this, it simply nothing short if an immensely powerful toolbox, with which you tackle most applied bio data science challenges!
